        <h3>Description</h3>
        “After two of those babies, the dullest, most by-the-book Vogon will be up on the bar in stilettos, yodeling mountain shanties and swearing 
        he's the king of the Gray Binding Fiefdoms of Saxaquine.”

            <li>1 bottle Ol' Janx Spirit</li>
            <li>1 measure Santraginean  Seawater</li>
            <li>3 cubes Arcturan Mega-gin</li>
            <li>4 litres Fallian narsh gas</li>
            <li>1 measure Qualactin Hypermint extract</li>
            <li>1 Algolian Suntiger tooth</li>
            <li>1 olive</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the juice from one bottle of Ol' Janx Spirit.</li>
            <li>Pour into it one measure of water from the seas of Santraginus V — 
                Oh, that Santraginean seawater! Oh, those Santraginean fish!</li>
            <li>Allow three cubes of Arcturan Mega-gin to melt into the mixture (it must be properly iced or the benzene is lost).</li>
            <li>Allow four litres of Fallian marsh gas to bubble through it, in memory of all those happy hikers who have died of pleasure in the Marshes of Fallia.</li>
            <li>Over the back of a silver spoon float a measure of Qualactin Hypermint extract, redolent of all the heady odours of the dark Qualactin Zones, subtle, sweet and mystic.</li>
            <li>Drop in the tooth of an Algolian Suntiger. Watch it dissolve, spreading the fires of the Algolian Suns deep into the heart of the drink.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Zamphuor.</li>
            <li>Add an olive.</li>
            <li>Drink... but... very carefully...</li>
        </ol>
